    <h1>Simple test of Google bot's JS capabilities</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Have you ever had an SEO question and went to the web in search for answers only to be overcumbered by contradicting opinions? Me too.</p>
    <p>This simple (very simple) test will try to answer only 1 question: <strong>Will Google bot index a page that has it's robots meta tag set to "index, follow" but dynamically modified to "noindex, nofollow" using JS?</strong> Some opinions say that Google will only look at the meta robots tag retrieved from the header response, meaning the source code, and not pay attention to the changes done after page load by JS. Other opinions say that it will take the JS modification into acount as it is getting better at understanding the whole picture by parsing not only the document but JS and CSS external files.</p>

      <li>This article says it will work but has no code examples. At the end it kind of contradicts itself with the JS time of excecution though (ugh). <a href="http://searchengineland.com/tested-googlebot-crawls-javascript-heres-learned-220157">We Tested How Googlebot Crawls Javascript And Here’s What We Learned</a></li>
      <li>This article has a link to reddit where a Google guy states that robots.txt only takes care of the crawling but not the deindexing. To deindex, you should set your meta tags right and let it crawl. <a href="https://www.seoinc.com/seo-blog/fastest-way-to-deindex-pages/">How to Efficiently Deindex Pages</a></li>
      <li>This link explains how disallowing crawling of your page using robots.txt won't neccesarily deindex the page and might still show in search engine results page. <a href="https://developers.google.com/webmasters/control-crawl-index/docs/faq#h17"></a>If I block Google from crawling a page using a robots.txt disallow directive, will it disappear from search results?</li>
